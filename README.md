### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Miraya**](https://mirayatech.notion.site/Miraya-Tech-2fa175720a2080879d27c23207346acb), a design engineer based in Germany. I like building clean, modern interfaces with smooth animations and keeping things simple.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- UI components with subtle motion
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish
