## Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50">

I’m [**Thenuri**](https://mirayatech.notion.site/Miraya-Tech-2fa175720a2080879d27c23207346acb), an undergraduate Software Engineer based in Sri Lanka. I design clean user interfaces, architect scalable backends, and explore intelligent systems that solve real problems.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- AI & Machine Learning  
- Building intelligent evaluation systems  
- Three.js & modern frontend interactions  
- Scalable backend architecture
- 
Currently, I'm developing a **dual-mode AI interview simulator** that generates resume-based and topic-based questions, evaluates answers using structured AI scoring, and provides targeted improvement insights.
