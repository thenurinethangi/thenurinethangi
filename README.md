### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Thenuri**](https://thenuri-nethangi-portfolio-8s47.vercel.app/), an undergraduate Software Engineer based in Sri Lanka. I design clean user interfaces, architect scalable backends, and explore intelligent systems that solve real problems.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- AI & Machine Learning  
- Building intelligent evaluation systems  
- Three.js & modern frontend interactions  
- Scalable backend architecture

Currently, I'm developing a **dual-mode AI interview simulator** that generates resume-based and topic-based questions, evaluates answers using structured AI scoring, and provides targeted improvement insights.

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Wattpad Clone](https://github.com/mirayatech/miraya-face-reveal) - A full-featured story publishing platform where users can write, publish, discover, rank, and engage     with serialized content through comments, likes, follows, and personal libraries.
- [SYNEMA](https://github.com/mirayatech/image-card-stack) -  A multi-cinema movie booking platform with real-time seat selection, secure reservations, and seamless online    ticket purchasing across multiple theaters and screens.
- [Flip](https://github.com/mirayatech/Anime-Scene-Gallery) - A production-grade productivity suite unifying structured scheduling, contextual notes, and repeat-aware task    systems with real-time sync.
- [Hospital Management System](https://github.com/mirayatech/NinjaSketch) - Backend-driven system managing patients, appointments, and staff using ORM-based persistence and    modular architecture.
