### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Thenuri**](https://thenuri-nethangi-portfolio-8s47.vercel.app/) , an undergraduate Software Engineer based in Sri Lanka. I build clean user interfaces, architect scalable backends, and explore intelligent systems that solve real problems in both web and mobile.

**These days I’m focused on:**

- AI & Machine Learning  
- Building intelligent evaluation systems  
- Three.js & modern frontend interactions  
- Scalable backend architecture

Currently, I'm developing a **dual-mode AI interview simulator** that generates resume-based and topic-based questions, evaluates answers using structured AI scoring, and provides targeted improvement insights.

**Some stuff I built:**

- [Wattpad Clone](https://github.com/thenurinethangi/Wattpad-Clone) - A full-featured story publishing platform where users can write, publish, discover, rank, and engage     with serialized content through comments, likes, follows, and personal libraries.
- [SYNEMA](https://github.com/thenurinethangi/SYNEMA_FRONTEND) - Multi-cinema booking system with real-time seat locking, reservation workflows, and secure end-to-end         ticket purchasing across multiple theaters and screens.
- [Flip](https://github.com/thenurinethangi/Flip) - Structured productivity system with intelligent task scheduling, repeat-aware logic, contextual notes, and real-time       synchronization.
- [Hospital Management System](https://github.com/thenurinethangi/Serenity_Mental_Health_Therapy_Center_System) - Backend-driven system managing patients, appointments,       therapy, therapy session scheduling, and doctors using ORM-based persistence and   modular architecture.
